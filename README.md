In this PySpark project, we analyzed home sales data using Google Colab and Apache Spark, performing SQL-based queries to determine average home prices based on specific conditions such as bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, and square footage. The project also showcased performance optimization techniques including caching, partitioning, and using Parquet-format data.
